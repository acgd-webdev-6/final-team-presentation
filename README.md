# Final team presentation

## Overview

- Each team will have time to meet with the teacher.
- You’ll be demoing your final, working, web app prototype to the teacher. The teacher will also want to navigate through the interface to form their own opinions.
- **Be prepared to demonstrate the app on both a laptop & mobile device.**
- The teacher will also want to hear a discussion of how you coded the application and what best practices were followed.
- After a Q&A with the teacher we’ll discuss the results of your rubric.
- *You’ll receive a grade by the end of the meeting.*
